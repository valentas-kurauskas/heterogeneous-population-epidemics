# Short description

A quick script to try to understand the effect of superspreaders using random graphs with a toy degree distribution. 

Each individual can infect *0*, *a* or *b* new individuals.
Proportion of individuals that infect *a* others in the population is *p_a*. Proportion of those that infect *0* or *b*
others is adjusted so that the basic reproduction rate R0 is as desired.

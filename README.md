# Short description

A quick script to try to understand the effect of superspreaders using random graphs with a toy degree distribution. 

A fraction *1-p_a-ε* of population infects *0* new individuals.
A fraction *p_a$ infects *a* new individuals. Finally, a fraction ε of population infects *b* new individuals (they are "superspreaders"). We assume that the basic reproduction rate R0 is known and adjust ε accordingly.
